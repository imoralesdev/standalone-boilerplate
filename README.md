# Updated Web Page Architecture (standalone-boilerplate)

This project utilizes modern tools and a streamlined development pipeline to create HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for web pages that integrate seamlessly into platforms like PHP or Sitecore. This update replaces older tools such as CoffeeScript and Gulp with more efficient and robust technologies.

## Key Features and Tools
- Babel (@babel/core, babel-loader): Transpiles modern JavaScript (ES6+) for compatibility with older browsers.
- Webpack: Modularizes and bundles assets with advanced optimizations, including:
- Loaders:
** css-loader, sass-loader: Enables processing of CSS and SCSS files.
-- file-loader, url-loader: Handles images and other assets.
-- raw-loader: Processes raw content like SVG files.
-- pug: Allows template creation with a clean syntax.
-- glslify-loader: Processes GLSL shaders for advanced visual effects.
- Plugins:
-- clean-webpack-plugin: Ensures clean builds by removing old files.
-- copy-webpack-plugin: Copies assets to the output directory.
-- image-minimizer-webpack-plugin: Optimizes image assets for better performance.
-- mini-css-extract-plugin: Extracts CSS into separate files.
-- terser-webpack-plugin: Minifies JavaScript for production builds.
- Sass: Streamlines stylesheets with advanced features like variables and mixins.
- PostCSS: Adds CSS transformations for enhanced browser compatibility.
- Nodemon: Automates server restarts during development.
- Morgan and Errorhandler: Provides robust logging and error-handling capabilities.

## Advantages
- Scalable and modular: Webpack ensures efficient asset management and builds.
- Modern workflows: Tools like Babel and Sass streamline development while ensuring compatibility.
- Enhanced performance: Image and CSS optimizations reduce load times.
- Flexible integration: Output files are easily deployable to platforms like PHP and Sitecore.

This architecture represents a significant upgrade, aligning with modern development practices to improve productivity and deliver high-quality web pages efficiently.
